# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges implemented in Java.

## About the Project

Advent of Code is an annual programming calendar with 25 algorithmic puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. Each challenge consists of two parts, and you earn a star for each completed part.

## Year 2022

I've currently solved several challenges from 2022. Each solution is contained in its own folder with source code, input data, and approach explanation.

## How to Run

Each solution is a standalone Java class. To run:

```bash
javac DayXX/Solution.java
java DayXX.Solution
```

Or open the project in your favorite IDE.

## My Approach

I strive to write code that is:
- Efficient in terms of time complexity
- Elegant in problem-solving approach

I document each challenge with algorithm descriptions and explanations of key insights.
